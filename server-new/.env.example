# Database
## For local development using the repository layout, prefer a relative path from the project root:
## Example: DATABASE_URL=file:./db/reviews.sqlite
## In production it's safer to provide an absolute path to avoid issues when process
## managers change the working directory (PM2/systemd). Example: file:/var/www/reviews-maker/db/reviews.sqlite
DATABASE_URL="file:./db/reviews.sqlite"

# Server
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173 # Update to https://reviews-maker.fr in production

# Optional: If your site is hosted under a path prefix (eg. https://example.com/reviews),
# set BASE_PATH=/reviews and the server will rewrite incoming requests to /reviews/api/* -> /api/*
# (This is recommended to fix mismatches between frontend base path and backend route mounting)
BASE_PATH=

SESSION_DOMAIN=    # Optional. Set to .yourdomain.com to share cookies across subdomains
