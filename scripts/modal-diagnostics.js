// Enhanced diagnostic helper: logs when modals open, prints computed styles for account modal
// and records timestamp + truncated stack to help identify the caller.
// Archived/neutralized: original modal diagnostics moved to archive/debug/modal-diagnostics.js
// Reason: repository cleanup — preserved archived copy. Restore if needed.
console.log('[ARCHIVE] scripts/modal-diagnostics.js neutralized. Original at archive/debug/modal-diagnostics.js');
